// This script http redirects the user away from the site index/dashboard based on a theme setting.

// Inclusion of this file is the earliest entry point from a theme load: (top of local.php)
// (without use of a local plugin to redirect early. Therefore it is not the most efficient,
// because a small, but reasonable amount of work has already been done to generate the current page)

// Detail:
// It doesn't make sense, when using the cass theme, to use either of the following:
// - The moodle core site index
// - The moodle core dashboard (i.e. the 'my' page)

// This is because:
// - Students don't care about a site index. Students want to be on their course pages.
// - Under cass, students don't need a separate dashboard because of the primary nav popup menu

// We have added a setting: 'coursepageredirect' to avoid the core site index and core dashboard page
// if a relevant course can be found for the user

// The user is redirected to the most recent timestamp for: 'course access' / 'enrolment'
// on all associated courses.

// Do nothing for AJAX calls and CLI scripts:
